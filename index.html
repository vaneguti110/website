    	 		<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        			<div class="third-width">
        				<p>I have made my home here in Berlin, Germany. My journey into tech started with my degree in Computer Science. When i took a class of web pages, using HTML, CSS and the program Abobe Suite like Flash, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Fireworks. I was fascinated it and I want it to learn more about it, but it took me a while realize that this was my passion.</p>

        			</div>
        			<div class="third-width">
        				<p>That passion and curiosity came back and then opened a door of opportunities that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom and versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I have made a full switch to frontend development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

        					<p>I will like to leave with a quote of Holstee Manifesto:</p> 
        					<span class="small_caps">“This is your</span> <span class="big">life.</span> 
        					<span class="small_caps">Do what you want and do it often. 
							If you don't like something, change it. 
							If you don't like your job, quit.</span>
							<span class="medium">If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV.
							If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; </span><span class="small_caps">they will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.</span>
							<span class="small_caps">Stop over-analysing, life is simple.
							All emotions are beautiful.
							When you eat, appreciate every last bite.<br>
							Life is simple.</span>
							<span class="small">Open your heart, mind and arms to new things and people, we are united in our differences.
							Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them.</span>
							<span class="big">Travel often;</span> <span class="medium">getting lost will help you find yourself.
							Some opportunities only come once, seize them.
							Life is about the people you meet and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating.</span>
							<span class="big">Life is short,</span><span class="small"> live your dream and wear your passion.”</span>
